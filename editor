<p>Hey, it's Me! I am a Software Engineer and a Machine Learning Enthusiast who loves to make things that make a difference. I recently graduated with a Master's Degree in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Arlington and also hold a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering from RTM Nagpur University. Getting insights and learning about new things is something that I like, thus I push myself to learn something new be it about Machine Learning &amp; AI, Software Engineering or even about the Universe itself (huge space geek!!!). Throughout my academics and various extra-curricular projects, I have acquired skills and the technical know-how that gives me the edge to achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer that can deploy a machine learning model to production.</p>
